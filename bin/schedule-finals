This script will schedule the finals, which are structured as detailed below,

usage: schedule-finals takes no arguments nor options. It will determine how many knockout (final)
matches have been scheduled thus far (org.srobo.matches.knockout_matches_scheduled),
and politely schedule the next set.

If there is no next set, you will be informed of that as well. ;)

The spare minute will be placed between matches (such that there is a minute of "downtime" between
consecutive final matches
16 top teams (in terms of league points) to play

(4 4-robot matches)

D: 4, 8, 12, 16

(where 1 is the highest scoring team and 16 is the lowest scoring team of the teams that got in)

the top two from each match then play
